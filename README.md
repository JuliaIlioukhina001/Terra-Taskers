## Inspiration

**Terra Taskers** was born out of the urgent need to combat climate change and inspire global citizens to take actionable steps toward a greener future. The project aims to address the challenge of finding impactful changes in daily routines and sustaining motivation to continue eco-friendly practices. By integrating extrinsic motivation and the power of blockchain technology, Terra Taskers provides a platform for users to engage in green tasks while being rewarded for their efforts.

## What it Does

Terra Taskers offers users a weekly list of specific tasks designed to promote environmentally friendly behaviors. Upon task completion, users can submit photographic evidence, earning them a payment through Circle and a spot on the global feed. The payment system not only offsets the costs associated with eco-friendly practices but also encourages users to actively participate in preserving the environment. The global feed showcases user achievements, fostering a sense of community and motivation. Terra Taskers thus employs both extrinsic rewards and social accountability to drive consistent commitment to eco-conscious actions.

## How We Built It

The frontend of Terra Taskers was crafted using HTML tags and CSS styling, with a shared stylesheet enhancing code readability. JavaScript was employed for interactive elements like the task submission and login forms. Accessibility was prioritized through alternative text for images, catering to users with visual impairments and assistive technologies. The color scheme and visuals aim to evoke environmental responsibility while ensuring inclusivity.

The backend relied on the Flask framework and Python for web app operations. Data was managed using the serverless platform Deta, offering file storage and a no-SQL database. To reward users, Circle interacted with blockchains, facilitating FLOW token payouts upon task completion. FLOW tokens were chosen for their low latency, optimizing user experience.

## Challenges We Ran Into

A significant challenge was ensuring task completion integrity and preventing misuse of compensation. The team devised a multifaceted solution: requiring image evidence for task claims, fostering commitment, and enhancing accountability. The public feed introduced an additional layer of peer oversight, discouraging false submissions. This holistic approach aimed to uphold the platform's integrity.

## Accomplishments We're Proud Of

The implementation of the social media-inspired global feed emerged as a complex achievement. Overcoming image storage obstacles using Deta, the team designed a feed structure displaying user-submitted images with captions, including usernames and completed goals. Financial transparency was also integrated, showcasing the total payouts for user achievements. Breaking down the challenge into manageable steps enabled the realization of this vital feature.

## What We Learned

Terra Taskers led the team to explore and embrace Web3 technologies. Circle's user-friendly integration surprised the team, and the simplicity of Flow's usage highlighted the potential of blockchain solutions. This experience underscored the value of Web3 tools in future projects, bolstering the team's confidence in their utilization.

## What's Next for Terra Taskers

The roadmap for Terra Taskers includes implementing AI to generate alternative text for images, enhancing feed accessibility for screen reader users. AI-driven content moderation is another goal, relieving the development team of manual oversight. Additionally, an AI-powered API could diversify task recommendations, considering cultural nuances. Collaborations with environmentally friendly companies and organizations are envisioned, introducing diverse funding sources while promoting impactful tasks and products.
